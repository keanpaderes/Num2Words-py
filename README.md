## Instructions
- **Use of CL Interface** - I've included a CLI for this function library. To access interface, use the start() function after importing it.
- **Import of the library** - Each functions can be used by themselves as long as the proper parameters is included. Just import it normally in Python.

## Functions
- **void numToWords** - Accepts a whole number from zero (0) to 1 million (1000000; without commas for example: 1,000,000) and prints on screen the number in word form.
- **void wordsToNum** - Accepts a number in word form (from zero to 1 million) and returns it in numerical form. Input must be in lowercase.
- **void wordsToCurrency** - Accepts two arguments: the first argument is the number in word form (from zero to 1 million) and the second argument is any of the following: JPY, PHP, USD. The function returns the number in words to its numerical form with a prefix of the currency.
- **void numDelimited** - Accepts three arguments: the first is the number from zero to 1 miliion, the second is the delimiter to be used (single character only) and third, the number of jumps when the delimiter will appear (from right most going to left most digit).
